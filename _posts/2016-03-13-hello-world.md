Hello, World! 

I know you must be thinking that he is yet another blogger who is going to prove why blogging is necessary and how he is going to complete his promise of writing good technical and non-technical stuff every now and then. 

Of course I am going to say this [HaHaHa]. So what is wrong with promising? The thing is you must complete your promise and I will try to do so. How? For that you must wait and watch.

## What is in it for me?

And the answer is I really don't know whether whatever I write will ever be useful to you or not but I can assure you that if I face a problem and I think I must tell, then I will. Not only to let my future self know where I went wrong, but also to let other people know that they need not go through the same path and waste lot of time on things someone has already figured out. 

It is probably mid night while I am writing my first blog post and I have to go for work so I will quickly wrap up this post by a quote which I like the most from The Shawshank Redemption: 

> Remember Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.
